# Question 12.2.1

# 1
#> In table1, there are 4 columns for country, year, cases, and population. 
#> In table2, instead of "cases" and "population," there is a new column "type" which lists either cases
#> or population and another column "count" which lists the value from table1 for each respective "type."
#> In table3, the "cases" and "population" is merged into a "rate" column (cases/population).
#> In table 4a, the years each get their own column with the number of cases in those years listed.
#> In table 4b, the years again get their own columns but now the population sizes are listed. 

# 2 Compute the rate for table2 and table4a+table4b

# Which representation is easiest to work with? With is hardest?
  #> The easiest representation to work with is table1, as the problem of adding rate can be solved using mutate()
  #> The hardest representation is table 2, as you need to first separate the cases and population into 2
  #> separate tables and then use those to generate a third rate table. You then need to rearrange the columns
  #> So that there is "type" and "count" so as to match table2 so you can bind the rows.
  #> table4a+table4b is simpler than table2, but you still have to create a new table for rates and 
  #> divide the values from the original 2 tables.

#1 Why are pivot_longer() and pivot_wider() not perfectly symmetrical?
